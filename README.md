## To do

### must have

[x] - should work offline
[x] - should sync when go online
[x] - should get changes to state when return in offline
[x] - should get up to date on first load online
[] - work flow from first visit to use
[] - revalidate data if it's old
[] - revalidate data button
[x] - show errors of mutations as toasts
[x] - logout logic

### nice to have

[] - storage availablility check
[] - use indexedDb to store input state (when user returns to application state should presist)
[x] - redirect from non-existing chats
[] - figure out non-image file handling
[] - offline mode button
[] - implement ctrl+z
[] - don't scroll on message delete
[] - minimize loading on start

## Issues

- up to date operation should recive data from server not just changes
