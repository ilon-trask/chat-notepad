## To do

### must have

[x] - should work offline
[x] - should sync when go online
[x] - should get changes to state when return in offline
[x] - should get up to date on first load online

### nice to have

[] - use indexedDb to store input state (when user returns to application state should presist)
[] - redirect from non-existing chats

## Issues

- when message with files is created, it flushes messages without files
- conflict of index
